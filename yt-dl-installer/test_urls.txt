Testing URLs that our installer should generate:

Expected format: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/VERSION/python-VERSION-amd64.exe

For Python 3.13.5:
URL: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.5/python-3.13.5-amd64.exe
Status: âœ… Confirmed working (28.8 MB file exists)

For Python 3.13.1 (fallback):
URL: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.1/python-3.13.1-amd64.exe  
Status: Should work (standard format)

Issue: The installer is failing to download, but the URLs are correct.
Possible causes:
1. PowerShell version detection failing
2. String parsing issues in NSIS
3. NSISdl download timeout
4. Firewall/proxy issues
